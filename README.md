# School of Conscious Communication

This repository contains the website for the School of Conscious Communication. It hosts the site's code, components, and static assets used to present projects, resources, and community information.

Origin: This project was initially scaffolded using lovable.dev. The site and repository have been adapted and are maintained locally from this codebase.

## Local Development Setup

This guide walks you through setting up and running the School of Conscious Communication website on your local machine. Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

### Prerequisites

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or higher). This includes npm, which is all you need.

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

```sh
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd School-of-Conscious-Communication
```

2. **Install dependencies:**

```sh
npm install
```

3. **Start the development server:**

```sh
npm run build
npm run preview
```

4. **Open in your browser:**

The terminal will print a local URL (typically `http://localhost:5173`). Open this address in your browser. The site auto-reloads when you save changes.

### Building for Production

```sh
npm run build
```

This generates a `dist/` folder with the compiled static files ready for deployment.

### Available Commands

- `npm run dev` — Start development server
- `npm run build` — Create production build
- `npm run preview` — Preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` — Run ESLint

## Editing the code
